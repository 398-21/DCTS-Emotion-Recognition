# Real-World Emotion Recognition with DCTS  
*A Synergistic Capsule-Transformer Framework*

This repository provides an overview of my final-year project on **Real-World Emotion Recognition with DCTS** (a hybrid Capsule-Transformer framework).  

The **full code implementation, training pipelines, and experimental results** are hosted on Kaggle:

## Project Summary
- **Objective:** Improve facial emotion recognition under real-world variability by combining the hierarchical spatial modelling of Capsule Networks with the contextual representation power of Transformers.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Capsule-Transformer hybrid (DCTS) architecture  
  - Feature generalisation across FER-2013 and RAF-DB  
  - Comparative benchmarks vs baseline CNN/ViT models  
- **Results:** Demonstrated improved generalisation with ~70% validation accuracy on combined datasets.
